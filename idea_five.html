        <p>3D scanning is the technology of the future... So how cool would it be if we could turn the main entrance to Atlas into a giant 3D scanner? Pretty cool.  Imagine for a second your the guy walking through this room:</p>

        <img src="/media/IMG_0883.jpg" style="max-width:600px;">

        <p>As you walk through the room you are also walking through a giant 3D scanner!  Kind of like the transporter in Star Trek, once you pass through, you materialize on the wall in this hallway:</p>

        <p>You get to miss all the messy bussiness of moleculy deconstructing and recunstructing and if you want you can even get a minature 3D printed version of yourself.  3D scanning technology is still going through a lot of development and the potential of scanning in real time like this still might still be a bit off.  But it's cool to think that this is something that in the not too distant future will be quite possible and maybe we will be the ones to figure it out ; )</p>
