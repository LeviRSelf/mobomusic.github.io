 		<p>When walking through the entrance way at Atlas most of the students and people don't tend to acknowledge or recognize the fact that they are indeed walking through a space.  Their heads are down and minds full of thoughts. Some students walk at a normal speed while others scurry down the hallways in a rush.  At different points of the day class lets out and a stream of students come swarming into the hall before quickly dispering in their many different directions.  They are caught up in discussions or are hurried off to their next class.  They don't tend to notice or experience the space that they are in.  As a society I feel we have forgotten to be present in our environment.</p>  

        <p>I would like to create an install that relates to the way we move throuhg a space.  By using the Kinect 360, or other techniques of camera tracking, I wish to follow peoples movements and react to those movements with sound.  Whenever someone walks through the hall a sound will accompany their walk.  If they walk slowly the sound will peacefully move with them.  If they walk rather quickly the sound will become slightly more unpleasant.  If there are a lot of people in the hallway the sound will become excited and match the chatter that accompanies the large influx of students.  All sounds while noticeable will attempt to not be unsettling as there are people who come to study or have quiet conversations.  If we use the right tones people will hopefully take more notice of the space and their movement through it, while offering soothing sound for those who are attempting to study and enjoy the space.</p>
