      	<p style= "font-size: 180%; font-weight:bold">Photogrammetry</p>

        <p>Photogrammetry is a technique used to create 3D models out of a bunch of pictures. 
        Itâ€™s being used for many purposes including movie productions and interactive websites, apps, etc.  
        Since Atlas is such a forward thinking institution I felt it would be cool to create a photogrammetric 
        representation of the institute that would be projected, or played on a LCD screen,
        and placed on the wall pictured below:</P>

        <img src="/media/IMG_0888.jpg" style="max-height:500px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">

        <p>Using the leap motion, people would be able to fly around the building and see it from multiple angles.</p>

        <p>Here is an example of a building represented using photogrammetry:</p>

        <p>Here is an example of Leap motion controlling a 3D Model:</p>

        <p>A further reiteration of this piece would involve creating different textures and skins for the model.  There could even be a contest in some of the 3D modeling classes where students could create skins for the building.  Class mates could vote on them and then which ever one won would be featured on the building for a period of time.</p>
