        <p>Following the same theme as mentioned in my previous idea I would like to create an install that still relates to the way me move through space, yet instead of using sound use a series of projected blocks.  I would project them on this wall:</p>

        <img src="/media/IMG_0889.jpg" style="max-width:600px;">

        <p>The blocks would originally be stacked up neatly.  When someone would walk past the wall slowly the blocks would move a little but not topple.  When someone walks past the wall at a faster speed the blocks would fall over and tumble around.  If many people walked past they would tumble and bounce around. Slowly over time the blocks would restack until the next person walked past.</p>
